# StockRateOfChange
Takes values from a spreadsheet, used yahoo finance, and makes a graph of the rate of change of the closing prices.

I used matplotlib and csv to make a program that takes, as input, a csv file in the format of yahoo finance and produces
a graph that gives the rate of change from day to day based on the closing price. 

To run it, change the name in the getData function and the month in the makePlot function to desired month. Place
.csv file in the same folder as the .py file and run the program.
